# Login 403 on fail

This **WordPress plugin** adds an extra layer of security to your site by setting a `403 Forbidden` header whenever a login attempt fails. While this won't change the experience for legitimate users, it helps *deter certain brute-force attack methods* by signaling that access is explicitly denied.

I personally found this plugin incredibly useful when I was facing a significant number of attacks on my WordPress site. By triggering a 403 response on failed login attempts, it discouraged attackers from continuing their attempts. Itâ€™s a simple, effective solution to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

Hope it helps you as much as it helped me.
